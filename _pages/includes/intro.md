I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanjing University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of Professor [Xu Jian](http://202.119.85.163/open/TutorInfo.aspx?dsbh=6!o846OAZIADvtaDDXvGCQ==&yxsh=4iVdgPyuKTE=&zydm=QP9JvMVDx3k=). My research interests include recommender systems, natural language processing, graph neural networks, and multimodal data analysis. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [huaizhenkou@njust.edu.cn](mailto:huaizhenkou@njust.edu.cn).

Prior to this, I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2018 from Qufu Normal University, under the guidance of Lecturer Zhenzhong Cao. In 2020, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree from Qufu Normal University, supervised by Professor [Lianyong Qi](https://sites.google.com/view/lianyongqi/home). In addition, I closely collaborate with Wenwen Gong (postdoctoral fellow at Tsinghua University), Yanwei Xu (Ph.D. candidate at Tianjin University), Hanwen Liu (Ph.D. candidate at Nanjing University of Science and Technology), Zeyu Lu (Ph.D. candidate at Nanjing University), Lina Wang (Ph.D. candidate at Shandong University), Yuwen Liu (Ph.D. candidate at China University of Petroleum, East China), and Lingzhen Kong (Ph.D. candidate at Nanjing University of Science and Technology).

To date, I have published 10+ papers in SCI journals such as ASC and KBS, with a total citation count of over ðŸ“Š300. Among my published works, three papers have become highly cited articles. 

Currently, I serve as a guest editor for the journal Intelligent and Converged Networks, and as a reviewer for journals and conferences such as ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks, IEEE Internet of Things, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, IEEE UIC 2022, and Scientific Reports.
